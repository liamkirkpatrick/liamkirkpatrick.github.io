    "section": "",
    "text": "The first paper of my PhD has hit the press!\n\n\n\n\n3D ECM scan of an ice core\n\n\nThis paper describes a new method I developed over the first two years of my PhD. Three-dimensional Multitrack Electrical Conductivity Measurements (3D ECM) enables non-destructive three-dimensional constraints on ice core layering. It is best suited to large diameter ice cores (e.g. the 241 mm Blue Ice Drill system used in the paper), although ongoing work shows we can apply it down to cores as small as 3”.\nIn a first application of this 3D ECM, we study the layering in the upper portion of two cores from the Allan Hills reigon. We find layering at 29° from horizontal in the ALHIC2201 core, and 69° from horizontal in the ALHIC2302 core. We show that this layering is generally consistent over the full depth range measured, with a gradual trend towards steeper layering at the surface. This suggests that layer orientations are likely driven by the bed geometry, not localized, meter-scale folding.\n\n\n\n\n3D ECM scan of an ice core\n\n\nThis paper provides the basis for multiple ongoing projects. For my next paper (expected to hit the press in summer 2026), I led the effort to apply 3D ECM to re-thinking our approach to sampling ice cores from blue ice areas with complex stratigraphy. Stay tuned for more!\n\n\nAbstract\n\nRecent ice cores from the Allan Hills, a blue ice area in Antarctica, are nearly 3 million years old. These cores extend ice core chronologies, enabling new insight into key climate periods such as the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. The interpretation of these climate records is complex because of the disturbed stratigraphy in this ice. Here, we present a new three-dimensional multitrack electrical conductivity measurement method (3D ECM) to resolve layer structure. We demonstrate this technique on a cumulative 60 m of two large-diameter (241 mm) ice cores, ALHIC2201 and ALHIC2302. Measurements were taken on the upper section of both cores due to better ice core quality in this shallow ice. We find well-defined and dipping layering in both cores, averaging 29° in ALHIC2201 and 69° in ALHIC2302 from horizontal. We observe a slight decrease in dip with depth in both cores, although it only achieves statistical significance in ALHIC2302. We discuss how this new method can be applied to enable accurate, high-resolution multi-proxy record development even in ice cores with steeply dipping layers. 3D ECM improves interpretation of blue ice area cores by providing accurate, non-destructive constraints on stratigraphy.\n\n\nAccess\n\nYou can read the paper at the Journal of Glaciology.

    "text": "After two years working with the Denali water isotope record, I was finally able to visit the drill site in person. Our small team of three University of Maine PhD students and myself (an undergraduate at Dartmouth at that point) spent the year working on proposals, grants, and permit requests. By spring, we had permission from the Park Service to work in Denali National Park, commitment of helicopter and ski plane support, $30,000 in funding (all from small grants), and a plan for an incredible month of fieldwork.\nOur team met for a crazy two days in Anchorage buying food and assembling gear. A quick shuttle got us to Talkeetna, and the incredible team at Talkeetna Air Taxi had our ski plane, loaded with gear, sitting at the Denali base camp on the Kahiltna glacier the very next day.\nOur first goal was to acclimate. After a night at base camp, and burying the bulk of our food, we geared up for a lap on Denali’s West Buttress. This famous climbing route is the main path up Denali, North America’s highest mountain. We started from basecamp at ~7000’. Two days on the route got us up to Camp 2 at 11,000’. We traveled at night, as the warm June days softened the snow surface and increased the crevasse hazard. After three nights at 11,000’ we felt strong and ready for the next phase of our trip. It took us two days to ski back to base camp. We used this journey to collect our first scientific data of the trip.\nWe had two goals on our descent of the Kahiltna Glacier. The first was to repeat a VHF survey down the Kahiltna glacier, first completed a decade earlier. Doing this allows us to compare the two surveys and to see changes to the snow and firn layers. (“Firn” is a word scientists use to describe snow on a glacier that’s over a year old. It’s still snow-like, but it’s on its way to being compacted into ice deeper down in the glacier). Our second goal was to collect snow surface samples, to undergo water isotope measurements. The ice core on Begguya contains a great high-resolution water isotope record, which I’ve been studying. My idea with these water isotope samples was to collect samples at a variety of heights on Denali, to understand what effect elevation may play in driving the isotope record.\nThe core of our work on the plateau was geophysics. The summit plateau is roughy one square kilometer, and we broke this into a 50 m x 50 m grid, marked out with bamboo poles. This let us do a highly detailed radar survey. We employed multiple VHF radar systems to studying the upper layers of snow and firn. We could match ice layers in the ice cores to reflectors in these surveys. HF (high frequency) radar surveys let us improve our understanding of bedrock topography and deep ice layers. And phase sensitive aPRES measurements, completed right after we arrived and then again two weeks later, let us watch the depth of internal layers over time and so calculate how quickly the ice is compacting. Note how quick this is - in polar regions it usually takes years, not weeks, to get enough ice movement to watch vertical deformation. However, the snow accumulation in the Alaska range is dramatically higher, measured in meters per year rather than centimeters in polar regions. The results of this survey were some of the most exciting of the summer.\nWhile I played a role in deploying the radar systems, my personal goal was to drill a shallow ice core. 20 m of core got us down roughly 5 years, enough to overlap a shallow core drilled in 2019, which in turn overlapped the original 203 m core from 2013. This core brought the record to present. In my proposals to fund this aspect of the project, I discussed how extending the record through to 2022 added significant value to the core. I thought capturing the COVID-19 pandemic was particularly interesting. Recent work with lead isotope measurements allows the identification of lead source regions. I’m excited to see if the ice core record is able to pick up the abrupt changes to global industry through the pandemic - this should be a good test of how our lead pollution proxies preform. I’m also excited to see how the strong 2016 El Nino manifests in sodium and water isotope signals. Even extending the snow accumulation and summer melt records another decade adds major value, as both have seen huge changes over the last decade.\nIn the end, we succeeded in reaching 20 m not once but twice. The first core was packaged in an ice core box, shipped carefully to Dartmouth College, and melted in the Ice, Climate, and Environment Lab. The second core was cut up in the field, with samples taken at ~25 cm resolution for water isotopes. This served a dual purpose. First, this gave us a backup in case the primary core melted (thankfully, it didn’t). Second, it allowed me to isotope melt-caused ice layers, and so see how these melt events impact the ice core record. Early results highlight that these ice layers are isotopically distinct from the ice and snow around them.\nAfter three weeks on Beguyya, we received a pickup from the National Park helicopter, and then a ski plane back to Talkeetna. I immediately set off on my carefully-planned ice core transport plan. The core first rested at a local grocery store (which generously permitted us to use their walk-in freezer), then an Anchorage fish packing facility, before being transported by Alaska Air Cargo, which placed it in a Seattle freezer during it’s layover. Jacob Chalif, lab manager at Dartmouth, carried the ice core on its final leg from the Boston airport to the lab freezer in New Hampshire.\nThis field season will always have a special place in my heart. I’m still amazed we pulled it off, returning not only safely but also with almost ALL of the data we set out to recover. We did so on a shoestring budget. Applying a very mountaineering style, with ultralight food, kitchen, sleep, and travel systems kept our weight low, minimizing helicopter and ski plane costs. While my future trips might reach more remote locations or colder temperatures, I’ll never be part of an all-student team figuring it out for the first time again.\nThis season wouldn’t have been possible without financial support from some incredible supporters of student research. I am thankful for funding from the American Alpine Club, the Dartmouth Dickey Center for International Understanding, the Dartmouth Outing Club, and the Dartmouth Earth Sciences and Environmental Studies departments, which enabled my participation in the field team. We’re also thankful for the support of folks on the ground in Alaska, including Talkeetna Air Taxi and the Denali branch of the National Park Service. Science takes a team!"

    "title": "Hercules Dome",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I was lucky to join a 4-person team on the ’22-’23 Hercules Dome field season. This season represented the final year of geophysical surveys identifying an ice core drilling project at Hercules Dome.\nThe broad goal of this project is to drill an ice core which will provide a history of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and so also of sea level rise. The last interglacial, a time period a little over 100,000 years ago, is the last opportunity to study how the West Antarctic Ice Sheet responds to warmer global temperatures. Some evidence indicates that the ice sheet may have almost completely collapsed durring the last interglacial, which would have massive impacts on sea level rise. Verifying this would help us understand the risk of changes over this and future centuries.\nAn ice core record could provide really great insights into the extent of this region of Antarctica in this warm period. However, it’s very tricky to find a site that holds that very old ice, remaining stable even if the West Antarctic Ice Sheet were to collapse, while also remaining close enough to carry clear signals of what happens in the West Antarctic. Hercules Dome is that magic site - (stable) beachfront property if the West Antarctic collapsed. If you’re interested in this project, I urge you to check out the Hercules Dome project website.\nOur goal this year was to go from a general sense of where to drill, to specifying the exact spot an ice core should go. Additionally, we were hoping to improve our broader understanding of ice dynamics in the reason.\nTo do this, we employed a range of radar technologies. We used a HF radar system, broadcasting at 3 MHz, to image deep ice layers and the bedrock at ~1700 m depth. A shallow VHF radar system (100-200 MHz) allowed us to visualize layers in the upper 100 m, understanding snow accumulation variations in the region. Finally, a phase sensitive radar system (aPRES) allowed us to very accurately identify the depth of layers at point locations. By comparing these measurements with those from previous years in the exact same spot, we are able to calculate the vertical velocity (compaction rates) of the ice at different depths. By putting these systems together, we are able to build a fairly comprehensive understanding of the ice flow in the region. Critically, this should give us the best odds of drilling a successful ice core which achieves the desired temporal scale.\nThe core of our team was four scientists. Myself, a fellow UW PhD student, a PhD student from the University of Maine, and my advisor (a UW professor). However, it took more than the four of us to get the job done. We were joined by a field safety coordinator from the US Antarctic Program, and two pilots and a mechanic from Ken Borek Air, who operated the Twin Otter we used to get to and from Hercules Dome each day.\nThe original plan was to spend a month camping at Hercules Dome, but COVID outbreaks resulted in significant delays and logistical interruptions. Our plan ended up settling on almost four weeks of day trips to Hercules Dome, from the US-run base at the South Pole. With weather delays, this did limit our time on the ground, but we were happy to still have an opportunity to do our science amid such a difficult year for Antarctic research.\nBelow are some of my favorite photos from the season. Some were taken by me, but the majority were by Kelsey Kushneryk, one of our pilots and an incredible photographer."
