# Liam Kirkpatrick's Personal Website

Welcome! This github repository holds my personal site. If you're here, I'm assuming you're interested in how I set up my site, and maybe want to fork it yourself. Please reach out if you want my take on this site template, what I've changed, and how it's working out for me.

You can view the site at [liamkirkpatrick.com](liamkirkpatrick.com) or [liamkirkpatrick.github.io](liamkirkpatrick.github.io). I have a custom URL, which costs $20/yr and I manage through squarespace. I got annoyed with drag/drop editing using squarespace, and have found quarto a much lower effort, higher return approach for website design. It's also allowed me to integrate and share some fun side projects (stay tuned for some in-progress efforts). 

I started from Dr. Gang He's [quarto academic website template](https://github.com/drganghe/quarto-academic-website-template). It's fantastic and user-friendly.
